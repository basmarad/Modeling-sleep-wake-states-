# Modeling-sleep-wake-states-
Exponentialdistribution/Survival Analysis/Markov Model

# Aim of the current investigation
By leveraging the statistical properties of the sleep and wake bouts distribution (exponential and power law respectively) and by stratifying the bouts based on their transitions, one could gain valuable insights into the network properties and dynamics controlling sleep wake states in order to plan the next step of neural circuit-based investigation.

# The state transitions we are focusing on:
NREM to Wake
NREM to REM
REM from NREM
Wake from NREM
Wake from REM

Other state transitions are rare and can be safely ignored in our analysis.
